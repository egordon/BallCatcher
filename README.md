# Ball Catcher
* Car_Lab_CAD: Groupd-up design for holonomic drive. Using quarter-inch acrylic layers and some 3D printed components.
* Car_Lab_Code: Firmware for the PSoC, brains of the chip (includes all Car Lab projects, see BallCatcher folder for that specific project)

## See Ball_Catcher_Final.pdf for full project description

**Abstract:**
In the face of multiple partially-successful attempts in years past, we were determined to build a robot that could catch a ball in real time. We constructed a Holonomic Drive Train that allowed our robot to maneuver at speeds on the order of 6-7 feet per second in any direction, and it could reach those speeds in under a second. Relying on the Pixy Cam, we were able to determine the position of the target ball in 3D space relative to the robot once every 20ms. With a gyroscope, we could keep our robot facing the same direction as it moved to catch the ball. In the end, any ball tossed within a 5-6ft radius of the robot would at very minimum hit the rim. While our robot is far from perfect, we think that we put forward a decent attempt to solve this high-speed, high-percision problem.
